## <font color='green'>Project Introduction</font>


Buying a home, especially in a city like Bengaluru, is a tricky choice. While the major factors are usually the same for all metros, there are others to be considered for the Silicon Valley of India. With its help millennial crowd, vibrant culture, great climate and a slew of job opportunities, it is difficult to ascertain the price of a house in Bengaluru.

Each row in the dataset gives us the information about a house and its cost, which in our case is the target variable

Our aim is to create a  basic `regression model` that is able to predict house prices for a house in Bengaluru region given certain conditions. This project is also a End-to-end ML project.

The frontend Web application is based on Streamlit and deployed on streamlit server with github
